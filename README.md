How to start up REST project:
1 - Download and open(Be carefull bcs pom.xml can broke down! when u r opening on different PCs so check it)
2 - In tests/helpers/InMemIoService there is void close with comments. This comments will create a file with database the same like in Tests. If u r lasy and dont want to create your own database u can uncomment and run 1 time tests.
3 - Than when u have database or dont have u can Run full project. it will be runned on http://localhost:8080/ 
4 - if u want check only GET, DELETE request than Google chrome is anough but for PUT or POST u should use some tools like 'Postman' what i used
5 - Thats All :)
